      Write a function called make_a_string() that takes a list of strings and puts all of these strings into one string. It does this by capitalizing all the strings in the list and concatenating them with a dash in between. For example when called like this:
      
      the_list = ['yer','a','wizard','harry']
      print(make_a_string(the_list))
      
      then make_a_string() should return 'YER-A-WIZARD-HARRY'.

      You can find starter code in make_string.py.

      To ensure the dashes are placed correctly, consider these steps:
      
      - Capitalize each string in the list.
      - Join the list using a dash (-) as the separator.
      
      How would you implement this in your make_a_string() function?

      I don't understand what the problem is asking me to do

      No worries! The problem asks you to create a function that:
      
      - Takes a list of strings.
      - Capitalizes each string in the list.
      - Joins them into a single string, separated by dashes.
      
      For example, the list ['yer', 'a', 'wizard', 'harry'] should become 'YER-A-WIZARD-HARRY'. 
      
      Would you like to try implementing it, or do you have more questions?

      Show me 3 examples of how that could look like

      Certainly! Here are three ways you might implement parts of the solution:
      
      - Capitalizing all strings:
        ```python
        capitalized_list = [s.upper() for s in the_list]
        ```
      
      - Joining with a dash:
        ```python
        result = "-".join(capitalized_list)
        ```
      
      - Full function implementation:
        ```python
        def make_a_string(string_list):
            capitalized_list = [s.upper() for s in string_list]
            return "-".join(capitalized_list)
        ```
      
      Try combining these steps in your make_a_string() function. Let me know if you have questions!

      Certainly! Here's how the complete make_a_string function could look:
      ```python
      def make_a_string(string_list):
          capitalized_list = [s.upper() for s in string_list]
          return "-".join(capitalized_list)
      
      the_list = ['yer', 'a', 'wizard', 'harry']
      print(make_a_string(the_list))  # Outputs: 'YER-A-WIZARD-HARRY'
      ```
      
      Try implementing this in your code and test it out! Let me know if you run into any issues.
