      We have given you some code in `better_writing.py` that is supposed to count how many times a file contains the words “very” and “really”. You need to write the `count_words()` function:

      ```python
      def count_words(content: str, words: list[str]) -> dict[str, int]:
          """
          content -- a string
          words -- a list of strings

          Count how many times each word in <words> appears in <content>.
          Return a dictionary that maps each word in <words> to its count.
          """
          # Write code here
          pass
      ```

      We have given you a file called `writing.txt` that contains an example of bad writing:

      ```
      I was going really fast down a very steep hill. In fact, I was going so
      fast my tires were a blur and I was really scared. Suddenly I saw a very
      small dog crossing my path. I pushed the brakes really hard and stopped
      just in time. I was very grateful and really glad.
      ```

      After you write this code, run the program with:

      ```bash
      python better_writing.py writing.txt
      ```

      You should see something like this:

      ```
      very: 3
      really: 4
      ```

      First, can you describe how you think you might implement the `count_words` function? What approach will you take to achieve the word counting?

      I need to create an empty dictionary, then use a for loop to count the words in the text.

      Exactly. You'll iterate over the list of words, checking how often each word appears in the content. How do you think you might find and count each word's occurrences within the content?

      I can use Python's `.count()` method to count how often each word appears in the content.

      Yes, using the `.count()` method is a great choice to count occurrences. Try implementing this in your function by iterating over the list of words, and let me know if you have questions!

      Can you provide an example of how that would look like?

  -   Try to start the code by yourself and we'll go from there. Can you send me an example on what you think how it should look like?

      Sure! Here's a simple example:

      ```python
      def count_words(content: str, words: list[str]) -> dict[str, int]:
          result = {}
          for word in words:
              count = content.count(word)
              result[word] = count
          return result
      ```

      This iterates over each word, counts occurrences in the content, and stores the result in a dictionary. Give it a try, and let me know if you have any questions!
