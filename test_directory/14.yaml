      Write a program in voting.py that takes

      a prompt (a string)
      The program should read from input a series of votes and then print out a dictionary that counts which person or thing got the most votes.

      For example, you could use this program to vote for your favorite foods:

      python voting.py food
      food: lasagna
      food: pizza
      food: chicken parmesan
      food: lasagna
      food: pizza
      food: pizza
      food:
      {'lasagna': 2, 'pizza': 3, 'chicken parmesan': 1}
      Or you could use this program to vote for your favorite CS 110 topic:

      python voting.py 'CS 110 topic'
      CS 110 topic: Dictionaries
      CS 110 topic: Bit
      CS 110 topic: Bit
      CS 110 topic: Dictionaries
      CS 110 topic: Bit
      CS 110 topic:
      {'Dictionaries': 2, 'Bit': 3}

      Hello @Armando Carreon, how can I help you?
      What do you think your approach should be for this problem? Can you describe the steps you need to take to solve it?

      I would approach this problem with the following steps:

      Set Up Input Handling: Use a loop to repeatedly prompt the user with the given string until they enter a blank line.
      Store and Count Votes: Use a dictionary to keep track of each item as a key, with the count of votes as the value.
      Display the Results: After the user stops entering votes, print the dictionary with the final counts.
      Could you show me how these steps would look in code? Seeing the main structure would help me understand how best to implement the input handling and counting logic.

      Great, you've outlined clear steps! Here's how you can implement these steps conceptually:

      Use a loop to continuously input votes.
      Use a dictionary to tally votes.
      After the loop, display the dictionary.

      Now you can try coding each of these steps yourself. Feel free to ask if you need help with a specific part!

      I understand the general steps, but I'd love to see how to structure the loop and dictionary usage in code. Could you provide an example of how the main loop and vote tallying would look? It would help me get a clearer picture of the setup.

      Sure, let's break it down. Here's a simplified structure:

      Initialize an empty dictionary for votes.
      Use a while loop to get user input until a blank line.
      Update the dictionary with each vote.
      Print the dictionary at the end.

      Now, try to implement this yourself. Let me know if you run into any issues!

      I'm clear on the overall structure now. Could you show me how the code would look specifically for updating the dictionary with each vote inside the loop? That’s the part I want to make sure I’m handling correctly.

   -  Try to start the code by yourself and we'll go from there. Can you send me an example on what you think how it should look like?

      Certainly! Here's what updating the dictionary might look like inside the loop:

      votes = {}
      while True:
          vote = input(prompt + ": ").strip()
          if vote == "":
              break
          if vote in votes:
              votes[vote] += 1
          else:
              votes[vote] = 1

      Try implementing this and let me know if you encounter any issues.
