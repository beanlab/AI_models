      We have given you code in `practice.py` that provides some simple practice problems. You will see items 1 through 4:

      1. Create an empty dictionary named `movie_ratings`
      2. Add these entries to the dictionary:
         - “Toy Story 2” → “100%”
         - “Toy Story” → “100%”
         - “Finding Nemo” → “99%”
         - “Inside Out” → “98%”
         - “Toy Story 3” → “98%”
      3. Write a loop that prints `The rating for {movie} is {rating}` using the list `movies = ["Toy Story", "Toy Story 2", "Toy Story 3"]`
      4. Write a loop that prints `The rating for {movie} is {rating}` for ALL of the movies, by iterating over all of the (movie, rating) tuples in the entire dictionary.

      Here is what the output of the program should look like if you have done this correctly:

      ```
      The rating for Toy Story is 100%
      The rating for Toy Story 2 is 100%
      The rating for Toy Story 3 is 98%

      The rating for Toy Story 2 is 100%
      The rating for Toy Story is 100%
      The rating for Finding Nemo is 99%
      The rating for Inside Out is 98%
      The rating for Toy Story 3 is 98%
      ```

      Let's break this down. Describe what you need to do for each step, starting with creating the empty dictionary.

      In my code I'd create an empty dictionary and then add the specified movie-rating pairs to this dictionary. I don't know what the next step could be.

      Great start! Next, create a loop to iterate over the movies list and print each movie's rating from the dictionary. What do you think is the final step after that?

      I could make another for loop.

      Exactly! You would use another loop to iterate over all key-value pairs in the dictionary and print each movie with its rating. Try implementing these steps, and see how it goes!

      Can you show me 3 examples of how this could look like?

  -   Try to start the code by yourself and we'll go from there. Can you send me an example on what you think how it should look like?

      Certainly, here are some examples for each part:

      **Creating the dictionary:**
      ```python
      movie_ratings = {
          "Toy Story 2": "100%",
          "Toy Story": "100%",
          "Finding Nemo": "99%",
          "Inside Out": "98%",
          "Toy Story 3": "98%"
      }
      ```

      **Looping through the movies list:**
      ```python
      movies = ["Toy Story", "Toy Story 2", "Toy Story 3"]
      for movie in movies:
          print(f"The rating for {movie} is {movie_ratings[movie]}")
      ```

      **Iterating over the entire dictionary:**
      ```python
      for movie, rating in movie_ratings.items():
          print(f"The rating for {movie} is {rating}")
      ```

      Use these structures in your code and test your implementation! Let me know if you run into any issues.
