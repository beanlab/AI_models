      We have given you some code in `pokemon_group.py` that is supposed to go through a CSV file that contains information about Pokemon and group all the Pokemon using whatever column you want.

      To complete this code, you need to write this function:

      ```python
      def group_pokemon(lines: list[str], column: int) -> dict[str, list[str]]:
          """
          lines: a list of lines, each line is a comma-separated list of values
          column: an integer column number

          Find all of the Pokemon who have the same value in the given column.

          Return a dictionary that maps the column value to the list of Pokemon.
          For example, if the column is the number 4, then the dictionary will
          map the Pokemon type (water, fire) to a list of Pokemon of that type.
          """
          # Write code here
          pass
      ```

      Notice that we are giving you a column here. You can’t assume the column is always 4 (the type of Pokemon). It could be any other column.

      We have given you a file called `Pokemon-small.csv` that contains a CSV with a just a few of the Pokemon. The full information it has is:

      - name
      - pokedex id (a unique number)
      - height
      - weight
      - type
      - secondary type
      - HP
      - attack
      - defense
      - special attack
      - special defense
      - speed

      After you write the code, run the program with:

      ```bash
      python pokemon_group.py Pokemon-small.csv 4
      ```

      You should see something like this, which groups Pokemon by their type:

      ```
      grass
      bulbasaur
      ivysaur
      venusaur
      fire
      charmander
      charmeleon
      charizard
      water
      squirtle
      wartortle
      blastoise
      bug
      caterpie
      metapod
      butterfree
      ```

      If you run it with:

      ```bash
      python pokemon_group.py Pokemon-small.csv 6
      ```

      You should see something like this, which groups Pokemon by their HP:

      ```
      45
      bulbasaur
      caterpie
      60
      ivysaur
      butterfree
      80
      venusaur
      39
      charmander
      58
      charmeleon
      78
      charizard
      44
      squirtle
      59
      wartortle
      79
      blastoise
      50
      metapod
      ```

      Start by describing what you understand this function needs to do. What approach do you think can be taken to handle CSV lines and group Pokémon based on a specific column?

      I need a for loop to go line by line and then analyze the data.

      Correct. You'll loop through each line, split the line by commas to get the values, and then use the specified column index to group Pokémon by that column's value. What do you think should happen after you've split a line into values?

  - role: user

      Extract the column value (key) and Pokémon name, then add it to the empty list.

      Exactly. Check if the column value (key) is already in the dictionary. If it is, append the Pokémon name to the list. If not, create a new key with the Pokémon name in a list. Try implementing this in your function. Do you have any questions about the next steps?

      Can you show me 2 examples of how the for loop would look like?

  - Try to start the code by yourself and we'll go from there. Can you send me an example on what you think how it should look like?

      Sure! Here are two examples to get you started:

      **Iterate through lines to extract values:**
      ```python
      for line in lines:
          values = line.split(',')
      ```

      **Use the extracted column value as the key:**
      ```python
      result = {}
      for line in lines:
          values = line.split(',')
          key = values[column]
          name = values[0]  # assuming the first value is the Pokemon's name
          if key in result:
              result[key].append(name)
          else:
              result[key] = [name]
      ```

      These examples should help you in constructing your loop. What's your next move?
