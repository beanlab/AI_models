      Write a program that:

      - reads lines from input
      - changes the lines so that:
        - words containing ‘cat’ are surrounded with a cat emoji
        - words containing ‘dog’ are surrounded with a dog emoji
      - prints out the new lines

      You can find starter code in cats_and_dogs.py, which also has comments guiding you through the exercise.

      When you run the finished program, you should see something like this:

      % python cats_and_dogs.py
      I like cats and dogs.
      I like 🐈cats🐈 and 🐕dogs.🐕
      You should doggedly concatenate your strings!
      You should 🐕doggedly🐕 🐈concatenate🐈 your strings!
      There is peace today -- dogs are sleeping with cats.
      There is peace today -- 🐕dogs🐕 are sleeping with 🐈cats.🐈

      This program has two pieces:

      - The main() function handles the input loop. You should recognize this from Unit 3. Review the guide on input loops as needed.
      - The do_subs() function takes the line and changes it as needed. This follows a new pattern, where you:
        - split() the line into a list of words
        - change some of the words
        - accumulate original and changed words in a new list
        - convert the list of words back into a string using join()

      To tackle this problem, let's break down the steps required for the do_subs function:

      1. Split the input line into words.
      2. Iterate through each word.
      3. Modify words containing 'cat' by surrounding them with a cat emoji (🐈) and words containing 'dog' with a dog emoji (🐕).
      4. Accumulate modified (and unmodified) words in a new list.
      5. Join the list back into a single string with spaces in between.

      Does this clarify the steps you need to implement? Let me know if you need more guidance!

      The problem asks you to create a program that reads lines of text input. For each line:

      - Identify words containing "cat" or "dog".
      - Surround those words with cat (🐈) or dog (🐕) emojis.
      - Print the modified line with the changes applied.

      Would you like specific guidance on how to implement each part?

      Certainly! Here are examples breaking down parts of the solution:

      1. **Splitting and checking words**:
         ```python
         words = line.split()
         ```

      2. **Modifying words**:
         ```python
         modified_words = []
         for word in words:
             if 'cat' in word:
                 word = f"🐈{word}🐈"
             elif 'dog' in word:
                 word = f"🐕{word}🐕"
             modified_words.append(word)
         ```

      3. **Joining and printing**:
         ```python
         new_line = ' '.join(modified_words)
         print(new_line)
         ```

      Implement these steps in your do_subs() function. Let me know if you have questions!
