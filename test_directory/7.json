    "Let's start by implementing the in_range function, which checks if a given number n is within the range of 1 to 100: `def in_range(n): 'Check if n is within the range of 1-100.' return 1 <= n <= 100` Now, let's implement the main part that generates 1000 random numbers between 1 and 101 and checks if they are in range: `import random def main(): for _ in range(1000): n = random.randint(1, 101)  # Generate a random number between 1 and 101 if not in_range(n): print(f\"Number {n} is out of range.\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()` The in_range function returns True if n is between 1 and 100, and False otherwise. The main function generates 1000 random numbers and uses in_range to determine if each number is within the range. It prints a message if a number is out of range. Try running this code and see if it behaves as expected! If you have any questions, feel free to ask."
