      We have given you some code in `calorie_lookup.py` that is supposed to do the following:

      - read a CSV file that contains lines of foods that list “name,calories”
      - put these into a dictionary that maps foods to calories
      - use an input loop to ask you to type in a food and then it tells you how many calories are in that food

      **Tasks:**

      Review the code that is written for you to see what it does.

      To complete this code, you need to write one function called `read_csv(filename)`:

      ```python
      def read_csv(filename: str) -> dict[str, str]:
          """
          Reads the CSV file with the given filename. It should
          have lines that are of the format "food,calories". This
          function returns a dictionary that maps food -> calories.
          """
          # write code here
          pass
      ```

      We have given you a file called `cereal-calories.csv` that contains a bunch of cereals and their calories per serving. The first few lines look like this:

      ```
      Apple Cinnamon Cheerios,110
      Basic 4,130
      Cheerios,110
      Cinnamon Toast Crunch,120
      Clusters,110
      Cocoa Puffs,110
      ```

      After you write this code, run the program with:

      ```bash
      python calorie_lookup.py cereal-calories.csv
      ```

      You should see something like this:

      ```
      Food: Count Chocula
      Count Chocula has 110 calories per serving
      Food: Apple Jacks
      Apple Jacks has 110 calories per serving
      Food: Life
      Life has 100 calories per serving
      Food:
      ```

      Great! What do you think you need to do to implement the `read_csv` function? Describe the steps you believe are necessary.

      I’d open the CSV file and read it line by line.

      Good start! What would you do next after reading each line?

      I’ll split it by the comma to separate the food name from its calorie count.

      Right. Once you have the food name and calorie count separated, how would you use them to build the dictionary?

      I’ll append each food and its corresponding calorie count to a dictionary.

      Exactly. Add each food as a key and its calorie count as a value in the dictionary. What would you do after populating the dictionary?

      Can you show me 3 examples of this could look like?

      I won't write the full code for you, but here's a quick outline:

      - Open the CSV file.
      - Read lines in a loop.
      - Split each line by comma to get the food name and calories.
      - Add them to the dictionary.
      - Return the dictionary.

      Try implementing these steps in your `read_csv` function. Let me know how it goes or if you run into any issues!

  -   Try to start the code by yourself and we'll go from there. Can you send me an example on what you think how it should look like?

      Sure, here's how some parts of the code could look conceptually:

      **Opening the file:**
      ```python
      with open(filename, 'r') as file:
          # Your code to read lines goes here
      ```

      **Reading and splitting lines:**
      ```python
      for line in file:
          food, calories = line.strip().split(',')
          # Add to dictionary
      ```

      **Adding to the dictionary:**
      ```python
      food_dict[food] = calories
      ```

      Now, try combining these ideas in your `read_csv` function and see if it works! Let me know if you have more questions.
