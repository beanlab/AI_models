      {"role": "user", "content": "Write a head program in head.cpp. The head program should read the first n lines of either a file or standard input. If n isn't provided, print 10 lines. If no file is provided, read the lines from standard input (cin). There are four possible scenarios for command-line arguments: 1. No arguments: the program should read 10 lines from standard input. 2. 1 argument that is an input file: the program should attempt to read 10 lines from the file. 3. 1 argument that is a number of lines n: the program should read that number of lines from standard input. 4. 2 arguments: the program should read n lines from the file. If the input file does not exist, the program should print an error message and exit. If more lines are requested than the input file has, the program should just print as many lines as the file has and no extras. Follow the formatting demonstrated in the example."}

    "To implement the head.cpp program, here's how you can approach each scenario: 1. No Arguments: Read and print 10 lines from standard input. 2. One Argument (File): Open the file and read 10 lines from it. 3. One Argument (Number of Lines): Read and print that many lines from standard input. 4. Two Arguments (File and Number of Lines): Open the file and read the specified number of lines. Here's an outline of the implementation in code: `#include <iostream> #include <fstream> #include <string> int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { int numLines = 10; // Default number of lines to read std::istream* input = &std::cin; std::ifstream file; if (argc > 3) { std::cerr << \"Usage: \" << argv[0] << \" [n] [file]\" << std::endl; return 1; } if (argc == 2) { // Check if the argument is a number try { numLines = std::stoi(argv[1]); input = &std::cin; } catch (...) { // If not a number, assume it's a file file.open(argv[1]); if (!file) { std::cerr << \"Error: Could not open file \" << argv[1] << std::endl; return 1; } input = &file; } } if (argc == 3) { // First argument should be number of lines numLines = std::stoi(argv[1]); // Second argument is the file name file.open(argv[2]); if (!file) { std::cerr << \"Error: Could not open file \" << argv[2] << std::endl; return 1; } input = &file; } std::string line; for (int i = 0; i < numLines && std::getline(*input, line); ++i) { std::cout << line << std::endl; } return 0; }`. This code determines the correct number of lines to read and the input source, whether standard input or a file. It attempts to open files only if necessary and checks for file open errors. Lines are read and printed up to the specified number or available lines. Try implementing this and see if it meets the requirements. Let me know if there's a specific part you need help with!"
