Both types have a value attribute that is taken from the token when the Parameter is created, so it's either the value from the ID token or the value from the STRING token.A DatalogProgram consists of schemes, facts, rules, and queries. The schemes, facts, and queries are of List[Predicate] type. The predicates in schemes can only have ID types for parameters. The predicates in facts can only have STRING types for parameters.
